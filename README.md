# Betalish!

Betalish is an invoice generator service at [betalish.se](https://betalish.se/).

## Completion 

It's about 1 % complete. There is currenty no invoicing functionality.

## Idea

Keep it simple, keep it stupid.

## Why?

I previously built a complex invoicing system, which went the way of the Dodo.
Now I want to build something dead simple.

Meaning unsophisticated. Using the simplest of web tech.

Because why not.

## Inter-not-ionalization.

It's meant for the Swedish market. You scale. Me not.

And it's all in Swedish. Enjoy!
